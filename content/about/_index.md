Like many people with a website on the internet, I'm a millennial who works in technology. This website acts a central repository for my writings & projects. Others sites I can be found on are [Twitter](https://twitter.com/apkallum) and [Github](http://github.com/apkallum). 

This website has two main sections: the [(b)log](/log) and the [projects & essays](/projects-and-essays). This distinction only exists so that content in the projects and essays section does not get drowned by the stream of posts from the (b)log.
