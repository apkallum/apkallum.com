I'm at a stage in my life where I'm exploring avenues to tread by. Therefore I am

* happy to read or talk about anything that would help me identify new avenues or further explore current ones (software (particularly in the third sector), Effective Altruism, development economics, AI policy etc);
* happy to be contracted or employed to work on any of the above mentioned fields, or fields adjacent to them.

I'm presently located in Montreal, Canada, but most happy working remotely. I can be contacted on k@this domain.

## Now
[Right now](https://nownownow.com/about) I'm staying in Montreal for a while. I have one part-time remote marketing contract that is due to finish soon.
